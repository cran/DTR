Function to simulate data from sequentially randomized clinical trials (Tang and Wahed 2013 [Epub ahead of print])
}
\description{
This function generates a data set from sequentially randomized clinical trials as described in the simulation study of Tang and Wahed (2013) [Epub ahead of print]. Instead of generating only the data for one of the first-stage assignments (e.g. A1), \code{\link{sim.CHR.data}} generates full data from a simple two stage randomization design with therapies A1 and A2 available at the first stage, and B1 and B2 available at the second stage. \cr

\details{
In sequentially randomized designs, there could be more than two therapies available at each stage. For simplicity, and to maintain similarity to the most common sequentially randomized clinical trials, a simple two-stage randomization design allowing two treatment options at each stage is used in the current version of the package. In detail, patients are initially randomized to either A1 or A2 at the first stage. Based on their response status, they are then randomized to either B1 or B2 at the second stage. Therefore, there are a total of four dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs): A1B1, A1B2, A2B1, and A2B2.
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
The function returns a data set with columns: X, R, Z, U, delta, V1 and V2.
\item{X}{first-stage indicator, X=0 if assigned to A1, and X=1 if assigned to A2}
\item{R}{response status, R=1 for responders, and R=0 for non-responders}
\item{Z}{second-stage indicator among responders (R=1), Z=0 if assigned to B1, and Z=1 if assigned to B2}
\item{U}{observed survival time, U is death time if delta=1, and U is censoring time if delta=0}
\item{delta}{censoring indicator, delta=1 for died, and delta=0 for censored}
\item{V1}{a binary covariate following Bernoulli(0.5)}
\item{V2}{a binary covariate following Bernoulli(0.5)}
