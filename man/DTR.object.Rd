\title{
Dynamic treatment regime object 
}
\description{
This class of objects is returned by the \code{DTR} class of functions to represent a list of survival estimates and estimated standard errors for dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs). Objects of this class have methods for the functions \code{print}, \code{summary}, and \code{plot}.
