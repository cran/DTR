Function to simulate data from sequentially randomized clinical trials (Kidwell and Wahed 2013)
}
\description{
This function generates a data set from sequentially randomized clinical trials as described in the simulation study of Kidwell and Wahed (2013). 
}
\usage{
simLRdata(n,max.c,pi.x,pi.r,pi.z,
mean.NR.1,mean.NR.2,mean.R.1,mean.R.2,
mean.RE.11,mean.RE.12,mean.RE.21,mean.RE.22)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.

\details{
In sequentially randomized designs, there could be more than two therapies available at each stage. For simplicity, and to maintain similarity to the most common sequentially randomized clinical trials, a simple two-stage randomization design allowing two treatment options at each stage is used in the current version of the package. In detail, patients are initially randomized to either A1 or A2 at the first stage. Based on their response status, they are then randomized to either B1 or B2 at the second stage. Therefore, there are a total of four dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs): A1B1, A1B2, A2B1, and A2B2.
}
\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned
The function returns a data set with columns: X, TR, R, Z, U, and delta.
\item{X}{first-stage indicator, X=0 if assigned to A1, and X=1 if assigned to A2}
\item{TR}{time to response for responders (R=1)}
\item{R}{response status, R=1 for responders, and R=0 for non-responders}
\item{Z}{second-stage indicator, Z=0 if assigned to B1, and Z=1 if assigned to B2}
\item{U}{observed survival time, U is event time if delta=1, and U is censoring time if delta=0}
\item{delta}{censoring indicator, delta=1 for event, and delta=0 for censored}
